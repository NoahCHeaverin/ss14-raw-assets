Hello and welcome to hell.
This'll hopefully serve as a reference for how the tileset used by the game was made.
For a base, you'll want the blank slate tiles in tile_reference_sheet.ase, either the topleftmost one ("no tint"), or the one two to the right of that with no borders.
There's the 8 color swatch used for the gray steel tiles directly underneath the topleftmost tile as well.
Note the palette mask to the topright, the light blue circles indicate where on the tile the brightness of the colors should be bumped down by -1 (modifier of -1)
Tiles larger than minitiles should likely include this dark spot.

== Light and dark tiles ==
Light and dark tiles are direct brightness/contrast shifts of the gray tiles with the following parameters.
Obviously tweak these if your tile comes out relatively too dark/bright.

=== Light ===
# Brightness : 85
# Contrast : 0

=== Dark ===
# Brightness: -60
# Contrast: 20

== Tile variation ==
Note the little pattern just below "No Tint" in the tile ref sheet.
This is how I pattern all of the normal tiles for variants. Light blue indicates tiles that should have their HSV value tweaked up a couple points and black indicates tiles that should have value tweaked down a couple points and their contrast upped slightly.
The actual numbers for this are *arbitrary.* Use whatever looks good for your tileset.
